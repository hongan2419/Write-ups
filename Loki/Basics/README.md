Guess what the flag is, and we will tell you if you're right!
## First glance
Just like the description say, this website take our input and check if it's the flag or not.

Howevery, nothing was sent to server, so this is a client-side checking. So this write up is almost about how do I debug, if you just want to check for the flag, go straight (here)[].
